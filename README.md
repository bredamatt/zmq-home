# zmq-home
This repository contains ZMQ examples. During XMAS 2018, the goal is to push towards improving my distributed system design and implementation skills. I decided to do so with ZMQ and by using the C++ binding cppzmq.

## Building examples
Naturally, this requires dependencies... But... You might wonder which ones? I would love to tell you... But doing so without knowing your OS would be difficult. I am too lazy to explain how to do this for every OS, but it can be done as follows on a MacOS (fairly simply, hence my level of laziness would prevent me from doing it...)

1. Open a terminal prompt and execute '$ brew install zmq'. This installs ZMQ on your MacOS.
However, to make ZMQ work with C++ you also have to install the C++ binder. This can be done as follows:

2. '$ cd $HOME/Desktop'
3. '$ mkdir zmq'
4. '$ cd zmq '
5. '$ git clone '
6. '$ mkdir build'
7. '$ cd build'
8. '$ cmake '
