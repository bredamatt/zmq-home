# zmq-home
This repository contains ZMQ examples. During XMAS 2018, the goal is to push towards improving my distributed system design and implementation skills. I decided to do so with ZMQ and by using the C++ binding cppzmq.

## Building examples
Naturally, this requires dependencies... But... You might wonder which ones? I would love to tell you... but I am too lazy.

### Deps
You need to build cppzmq and bind it to zmq for the examplees here to work on your machine.
